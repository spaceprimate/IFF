<p>Across Europe, the Middle East, Russia, and in many other countries, having a meal is an event filled with family, great food and wonderful conversation. St. Basil Antiochian Orthodox Church in Metairie is bringing back the tradition of breaking bread together. But instead of the traditional three-hour meal, the congregation wants to break bread for three days with music, dancing, and a celebration of cultures from around the world! The St. Basil International Food Festival kicks off Friday, November 4 at the church grounds in Metairie, 3916 Hudson Street, across from the East Jefferson General Hospital Emergency Room. </p>
